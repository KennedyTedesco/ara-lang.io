# Classes

## Introduction

Classes provide a way to group functionality and state together.

### Defining a class

A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class and a block of code.

```
class Example {
    // ...
}
```

## Instantiation

To create an instance of a class, use the `new` keyword followed by the name of the class.

```
function main(): void {
    $counter = new Example();
}
```

Refer to [Expressions: Class Operations - Instantiation](../expressions/class-operations.md#instantiation) for more information.
